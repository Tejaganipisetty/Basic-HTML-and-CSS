    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace 
        scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and 
        raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent 
        the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) 
        and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. 
        He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
        He also played a pivotal organisational, 
        technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear 
        tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

        State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat 
        owner and imam of a local mosque;his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father

        Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after 
        becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a 
        small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working 
        under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, 
        the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian 
        Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) 
        which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
        In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers
